# PowerOfMath-AWS-WebApp

In this project, I designed and built a simple web application on AWS from scratch.

Five different AWS services were used: Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB

The application is a basic exponent calculator where the user can provide the console with a base and exponent and can expect to receive the correct answer back.
